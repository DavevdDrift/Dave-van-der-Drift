							<h1>Remake Family Sports app </h1>

							<p class="Inleiding">During the first half of the fourth school year I followed the course “Project 4 Autonomous Design”. In this course I redesigned the Family Sports app.
							</br></br>
							Family Sports is a fitness company located in Wateringen. The company wants everyone to perform at their best. Because of this, Family Sports developed an app. The app explains exercises and has different functions, such as testing your BMI. In addition, the app also provides information about the company itself, such as news, contact information, schedules for (group)lessons and information about their company.
							</br></br>
							However, the app had major room for improvement. New functions have been added, old functions have been improved, the User Experience has been improved and the visual design got an update. Because of this, the app will be better at informing the User about Family Sports, guide the user with their training and diet and it makes the user more excited to exercise.

						<h3>Issue</h3>
						<p>A lot of the people who are member of Family Sports aren’t using the app or don’t even know it exists. As a result, they are missing out on a lot of knowledge about exercises, information and news about  the company. Family Sports wants to change this by redesigning the app. It’s a question what the correct addition and / or adjustment will be to solve this problem.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p>The aim is to improve the functions, user experience and visual design. This needs to be done in order to make the app more exciting to use. The more exciting it will be to use the app, the more people will start to use it. As a result, they will get assistance and knowledge about exercises, diet, information and news about  the company.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Research Question</h3>
						<p>A research question has been formulated based on the problem definition and the objective. 
						</br></br>
						The research question formulated on the basis of the problem definition and objective goes as follows:
						“What does the Family Sports app need to make using the app more exciting in order to get  assistance and knowledge about exercises, diet, information and news about  the company. ”

						</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Target Audience </h3>
						<p>The target group are the members of Family Sports. These are people who are at least 16 years old, who exercise at Family Sports. It’s useful for them to have information about exercises, diet, information and news about  the company.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>The hi-fi prototype of the app represents the research and answers the main question. An application has been developed that guides the user with training, nutrition and progression tracking. The user can look up various types of information about nutrition, training and Family Sports itself.</p>	
					</li>

					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Feedback</h3>
						<p>Everyone loved the new redesign and functions of the new Family Sports app. They couldn’t wait to eventually use it.</p>
